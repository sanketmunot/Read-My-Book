# Read My Book

The traditional way of reading a book is through a printed copy. It’s not possible to carry a physical copy of a book everywhere, that’s when e-books came in handy. Printed books as well as e-books affect the eyes. Visual impairment is one of the biggest limitation for humanity, especially in this day and age when information is received by reading a lot of books (electronic and paper based). A study performed on “Listening or Reading: what’s more effective?” shows us that people tend to understand more while listening to book rather than reading it. 

Considering the result “Read my book” is a website which converts hardcopy of a book into mp3 audible format. On this platform user just needs to upload the image of pages which will be converted into an audible form. The end user will not have to worry about eye problems. This web based platform converts the book into a saga which you can listen and thus carry the book anywhere by a few clicks.

The purpose behind this project is to provide a web-based platform which converts any textual snippet into an .mp3 audible format, which the end user can listen to whenever they want .The main objective is take an input image from the user in the web interface and process it to extract text, which then shall be converted into speech .Our platform also provides a Mail Service where audio format that is generated can be sent to the mail address provided by the user.

 Reading books and e-books have effects on your health. Most of the problems is caused in eye i.e eye straining. Elderly people have a problem with the eyesight.  Reading books is not possible for them. As a solution to this problem “Read My Book” provides an audio of the book to the user so that they can listen to book instead of reading.

Visually impaired people require special type of books which tend to be costlier than the normal one. As we observe these students lack in receiving proper education due to their disability and we live in a society where spoon feeding is preferred more henceforth there is not much of effort put to help these students.So providing them with the audio of the book freely is one of the objective.
